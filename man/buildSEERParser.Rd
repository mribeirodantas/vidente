\description{
Datasets downloaded from SEER website (after the request process) come in
a compressed file containing, among other things, a .sas file with
instructions on data fields (fields width) to parse the text files and also
one sentence explanation for every field. One can also obtain data from SEER
through the SEER*Stat software. In this case, the text file may come in
different ways that are explained in a dictionary file (.dic).
