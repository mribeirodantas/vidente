\title{vidente: A package for parsing and preprocessing SEER data.}
\description{
The vidente package provides two categories of important functions.
Functions to parse SEER data and functions to preprocess it.
}
\section{Parsing data}{

 The \link{buildSEERParser} function builds parsing instructions based on the
 instructions in the downloaded folder (.sas file) or in the dictionary file
 exported from SEER*Stat software.

 The \link{readSEER} function reads the SEER data from ASCII text files
 downloaded from SEER website or exported from SEER*Stat software based on
 the instructions provided in the dictionary (.dic) or .sas file.
 
 The \link{listPrimarySites} function provides a list of keywords recognized
 recognized as primary site names in the terminology adopted by SEER so that
 you know what primary sites you can provide as the primary_site parameter
 for the readSEER function.
}

\section{Preprocessing data}{

 The \link{plotHistNA} function plots a histogram of the proportion of NA
 values for every feature in the dataframe.
 
 The \link{removeFullNAFeatures} function removes features whose all values
 are NA (or along with some additional NA value such as "Blank(s)", as some
 datasets exported from SEER*Stat software).
 
 The \link{findSingleValueFeatures} function finds features with an unique
 value for all rows in the dataframe. This can help you find features that
 can be removed for they only add overhead to the analysis.

 The \link{getNormalizedEntropy} function calculates the normalized entropy
 by dividing the entropy by the information length (number of unique possible
 values by feature). This ratio is also called metric entropy and is a measure
 of randomness of the information.
