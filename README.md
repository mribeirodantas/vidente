# vidente

vidente is an R package that contains tools to parse and analyze the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database.
Though there are other R packages with similar goals, they're either too limited or too focused in one way of parsing/analyzing it.
vidente has been developed making sure it will be useful to anyone willing to analyze SEER data, or at least parse its ASCII data files.
